/// `PositionEncodingKind` describes the encoding used for the `Position` `character`
/// column offset field. The `Position` `line` field is encoding agnostic, but the
/// `character` field specifies the number of characters offset from the beginning of
/// the line, and the "character" size is dependent on the encoding. The LSP specification
/// states:
///
/// - UTF8: Character offsets count UTF-8 code units (e.g. bytes).
/// - UTF16: Character offsets count UTF-16 code units (default).
/// - UTF32: Character offsets count UTF-32 code units (these are the same as Unicode
///   codepoints, so this `PositionEncodingKind` may also be used for an encoding-agnostic
///   representation of character offsets.)
///
/// The `vscode-languageclient` library that Positron uses on the frontend to create the
/// `Client` side of the LSP currently ONLY supports `UTF16`, and will error on anything
/// else. Their reasoning is that it is easier for the server (ark) to do the re-encoding,
/// since we are tracking the full document state. Track support for UTF-8 here:
/// https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-languageserver-node/issues/1224
///
/// The other interesting part of this is that `TextDocumentContentChangeEvent`s that
/// come through the `did_change()` event and the `TextDocumentItem` that comes through
/// the `did_open()` event encode the `text` of the change/document in UTF-8, even though
/// the `Range` (in the case of `did_change()`) that tells you where to apply the change
/// uses UTF-16, so that's cool. UTF-8 `text` is forced to come through due to how the
/// LSP specification uses jsonrpc, where the content fields must be 'utf-8' encoded:
/// https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#contentPart
/// This at least means we have a guarantee that the document itself and any updates to
/// it will be encoded in UTF-8, even if the Positions are UTF-16.
///
/// So we need a way to convert the UTF-16 `Position`s to UTF-8 `tree_sitter::Point`s and
/// back. This requires the document itself, and is what the helpers in this file implement.
