# The libR-sys package doesn't currently provide bindings for R on aarch64
# Linux platforms, so on those systems we need to add the use-bingen feature,
# which causes the package to build its own bindings from scratch.
# 
# Note that this typically requires the `llvm` and `clang` packages to be 
# installed on the build host.
