<!--

Thanks for taking the time to file an issue!

While Ark aims to be a multi-IDE project, its main target is the Positron IDE (https://github.com/posit-dev/positron) and we coordinate all bug reports and feature requests relevant for Positron in its Github issues page. Please consider posting your issue at https://github.com/posit-dev/positron/issues.

Examples of issues that should be posted to the Ark repository:

- Internal tasks and refactoring.
- Issues and feature requests that only concern Jupyter applications and that do not affect Positron.

Examples of issues that should be posted to the Positron repository:

- Issues and feature requests to components of Ark that directly affect the experience in Positron, such as LSP support.
- RStudio API support.
