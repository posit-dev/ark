# Was necessary after switching to dev tree-sitter to fix this warning:
# > some crates are on edition 2021 which defaults to `resolver = "2"`, but
# > virtual workspaces default to `resolver = "1"`.
#
# Also necessary to enable the `testing` feature of harp only when testing
# (i.e. when building downstream packages like Ark with Harp's `testing`
# feature set in `dev-dependencies`).
